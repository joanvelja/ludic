# Plan: Review RM Training Tokenization Flow
> From: Planner | To: Doer | Timestamp: 2026-01-21 14:22:41

## Objective

**Deliverable**: Assessment of RM (reward model) training tokenization pipeline, potential simplifications, and risk points.
**Definition of Done**: Clear map of RM tokenization flow + concrete streamlining suggestions consistent with CONSIDERATIONS.md.

## Pre-Execution Checklist

Before starting, Doer should verify:
- [ ] Repo root is `/Users/joalja/Documents/Github/ext/ludic`
- [ ] `CONSIDERATIONS.md` is read and in mind

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Locate RM training code
**Goal**: Identify modules/scripts for RM training and dataset processing.

| Step | Action | Target | Details | Verification |
|------|--------|--------|---------|--------------|
| 1.1 | Search | `src/` | `rg "reward model|reward_model|rm"` | Candidate files listed |
| 1.2 | Search | `examples/` `scripts/` | Same query | Example scripts found |
| 1.3 | Inspect | Candidate files | Follow tokenization/dataflow | Flow notes |

**Phase 1 Checkpoint**: Inventory of RM training entry points + tokenization code paths.

### Phase 2: Analyze tokenization shenanigans
**Goal**: Identify back-and-forth tokenization or retokenization cycles.

| Step | Action | Target | Details | Verification |
|------|--------|--------|---------|--------------|
| 2.1 | Trace | Tokenization functions | Note where text->tokens->text->tokens occurs | Map created |
| 2.2 | Assess | Each conversion | Determine if necessary or buggy | Notes + risks |
| 2.3 | Propose | Streamlining | Simplify with minimal changes | Suggestions documented |

**Phase 2 Checkpoint**: Streamlining recommendations with justification.

## Constraints

### Must Do
- [ ] Use file/line references in findings
- [ ] Tie recommendations to CONSIDERATIONS.md principles

### Must NOT Do
- [ ] Do not modify code

## Escalation Protocol

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Unsure which modules are RM-related | `/escalate planner` with question |
| Tokenization flow unclear | `/escalate planner` with specific file/line |

## Verification Checklist

When complete, Doer should verify:
- [ ] All RM tokenization flows traced
- [ ] At least 1-3 concrete streamlining suggestions

## Handoff Instruction

When execution is complete:
- If all verification passes: `/escalate planner` with completion summary
- If blocked: `/escalate planner` with blocker details

Estimated execution complexity: Medium
Estimated time: 30-45 min
